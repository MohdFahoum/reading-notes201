### HTML TEXT 

When creating a web page, you add tags (known as markup) to the contents of the page.
These tags provide extra meaning and allow browsers to show users the
appropriate structure for the page.

*headings: 

<h1>is used for main headings

<h2>is used for subheadings


<h3>If there are further sections under the subheadings
and so on till the 

<h6> element is the smallest.

The exact size at which each browser shows the headings can vary slightly.
Users can also adjust the size of text in their browser.

#### Paragraphs

paragraph tag <p> should surround every paragraph of text in your content.
Multiple line breaks in your source code (without the <br> line-break tag) will not display as line breaks on-page.
In order to get proper display spacing between paragraphs of text, you should use the <p> tag.

#### St rong & Emphasis

Many HTML elements have been designed to add semantic meaning to the content of a webpage. What this means, 
is that certain HTML elements imply a specific meaning with regard to the contents of the element.

For example, the use of emphasis tags, <em>, 
is rendered by a browser using an italic font and implies that the contents of the element should be read and understood with greater emphasis than surrounding content
While not all HTML elements carry semantic meaning, it is important to use HTML tags according to their semantic meaning whenever possible.

#### Definitions, Quotes, Acronyms
There are several very helpful span-level markup elements that are never used.

These provide fine-grain information about the word on your page. They can help users better understand your content,
and they can help computers (search engines, artificial intelligence) make better sense of what you have written.

<dfn> — The definition tag. This can be for the first time you use and define a technical term.
<abbr> — Used for abbreviations. You can put the expanded form of the abbreviation in the title tag.
<q> — Most people just use typographical quote marks to delineate quotations, 
but using the markup makes it more explicit, and allows you to reference the source of the quote with the <cite> element.
