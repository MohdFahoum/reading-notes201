### LINKS 

To insert a link, the tag that we're going to use is very easy to remember: <a>. However, an attribute, href, to it to indicate the page the link should lead to.
  
For example, the code below is a link that leads to Google, located at the address http://www.google.com:

<a href="http://www.google.com">Google</a>

We're going to include this link in a paragraph. So here's how you reproduce the example in the next figure:

<p>Hello. Do you want to visit the website <a href="http://www.google.com">Google</a>?<br />
It's a good website! ;-)</p>

By default, the link is highlighted in blue. If you've already opened the page, the link is displayed in purple.

We'll see how to change this appearance when we study CSS.

f you want to make a link to another site, you can just copy its address (called a URL) inhttp://.

Note that some links sometimes start withhttps://(secure websites) or other prefixes (ftp://, etc.).

*The links that we have seen are called absolute links since the full address is shown.
We are now going to see that we can write the links in a somewhat different way which will be useful for making links between the pages of our website.
