### LINKS 

To insert a link, the tag that we're going to use is very easy to remember: <a>. However, an attribute, href, to it to indicate the page the link should lead to.
For example, the code below is a link that leads to Google, located at the address http://www.google.com:
<a href="http://www.google.com">Google</a>
