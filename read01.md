### HTML

Structure of HTML 

![link](https://notesformsc.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/HTML-Structure.png)

*Just like a regular document, an HTML document has a structure. Unlike a regular document, a lot of its structure is mandated by the HTML Specification, as I discussed in the Who Controls HTML article.

####HTML Documents

All HTML documents must start with a document type declaration. 

HTML versions have its own declaration type and since we're going to use HTML 5, the declaration should be:
< !DOCTYPE html >.

After the declaration, HTML document itself begins with < html > and ends with < /html >.
The visible part of the HTML document is between < body > and < /body >.

*HTML Paragraphs
If the content is a paragraph, then you must label it using HTML paragraph tag. It is defined with the < p > tag

*HTML Links
HTML links are those clickable and moving you to another web page or content. It is defined with the < a > tag

#### tags

* Tags are often referred to as elements.

* Tags usually come in pairs. The opening tag denotes
the start of a piece of content; the closing tag denotes
the end.

* Opening tags can carry attributes, which tell us more
about the content of that element.

* To learn HTML you need to know what tags are
available for you to use, what they do, and where they
can go.






### Java Script

*what is script ?
*script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow to achieve a goal.
and these instrucrtins the computer will follow step by step

to write a script you have to follow some of tips 

* DEFINE THE GOAL
* DESIGN THE SCRIPT
* CODE EACH STEP

flow chart will be the hight level view for your script
designing script should contain steps , as the computer will follow 
these instructions one by one ,

To approach writing a script, break down your goal into
a series of tasks and then work out each step needed
to complete that task (a flowchart can help).

below is an example :

1. check the car oil status

2. get the oil catch machine

3. put the machine on the car and press start

4. but the new oil 

5. check the oil level

### objects 

In computer programming, each physical thing in
the world can be represented as an object.

Each object can have its own:

• Properties

• Events

• Methods

Together they create a working model of that object.
