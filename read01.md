Structure of HTML 

![link](https://notesformsc.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/HTML-Structure.png)

*Just like a regular document, an HTML document has a structure. Unlike a regular document, a lot of its structure is mandated by the HTML Specification, as I discussed in the Who Controls HTML article.

####HTML Documents

All HTML documents must start with a document type declaration. 

HTML versions have its own declaration type and since we're going to use HTML 5, the declaration should be:
< !DOCTYPE html >.

After the declaration, HTML document itself begins with < html > and ends with < /html >.
The visible part of the HTML document is between < body > and < /body >.

To approach writing a script, break down your goal into
a series of tasks and then work out each step needed
to complete that task (a flowchart can help).

### objects 

In computer programming, each physical thing in
the world can be represented as an object.

Each object can have its own:

• Properties

• Events

• Methods

Together they create a working model of that object.
