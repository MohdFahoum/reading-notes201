### What is HTML Form

HTML Forms are required to collect different kinds of user inputs, such as contact details like name, email address, phone numbers, or details like credit card information, etc.

Forms contain special elements called controls like inputbox, checkboxes, radio-buttons, submit buttons, etc.
Users generally complete a form by modifying its controls e.g. entering text, selecting items, etc.
and submitting this form to a web server for further processing.


*Input Element
This is the most commonly used element within HTML forms.

It allows you to specify various types of user input fields, depending on the type attribute.
An input element can be of type text field, password field, checkbox, radio button, submit button, reset button, file select box,
as well as several new input types introduced in HTML5.

*Text Fields

Text fields are one line areas that allow the user to input text.

Single-line text input controls are created using an <input> element, whose type attribute has a value of text


### Tables and Forms 

The HTML tables allow web authors to arrange data like text, images, links, other tables, etc. into rows and columns of cells.

The HTML tables are created using the "table" tag in which the "tr" tag is used to create table rows and "td" tag is used to create data cells.
The elements under "td" are regular and left aligned by default

*Table Heading 

Table heading can be defined using th tag.
This tag will be put to replace td tag, which is used to represent actual data cell.
Normally you will put your top row as table heading as shown below, otherwise you can use th element in any row.
Headings, which are defined in th tag are centered and bold by default.




*Cellpadding and Cellspacing Attributes
There are two attributes called cellpadding and cellspacing which you will use to adjust the white space in your table cells.
The cellspacing attribute defines space between table cells, while cellpadding represents the distance between cell borders and the content within a cell.
