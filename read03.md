### Lists

HTML provides us with three different types:
*orderd lists "ol"
*un-orderd lists "ul"
*definition lists "dl"

### Boxes

All HTML elements can be considered as boxes.The CSS box model is essentially a box that wraps around every HTML element. 
It consists of: margins, borders, padding, and the actual content.



*Block and inline boxes
In CSS we broadly have two types of boxes — block boxes and inline boxes. These characteristics refer to how the box behaves in terms of page flow, and in relation to other boxes on the page:

If a box is defined as a block, it will behave in the following ways:

The box will break onto a new line.
The box will extend in the inline direction to fill the space available in its container. In most cases this means that the box will become as wide as its container, filling up 100% of the space available.
The width and height properties are respected.
Padding, margin and border will cause other elements to be pushed away from the box

### Decisions and Loops

here we have 3 diffirent types : 

* if , else 

If and else are used in JavaScript (and in many other programming languages) like in english.
You are lucky that your native language is English
One observation is that there is only one line of code after the if statement.
If I want to include more instructions I need to include them into curly braces
else goes at the end of the if and it handles any situation not already handled at that point.



* switch 

Let us assume we are checking something, mostly likely a variable name.
Switch is another way to test but by jumping directly to the memory location of interests,
without going over all possible tests.

so what's this break? Well, this break stops any more tests being made. So, if the first check was true (name entered was mary), the instruction break tells the browser: “don't do any more checks”.

So break is used to stop any more case comparisons. Sometimes break is appropriate, sometimes it isn't.




* while 

starting with the while loop. There is also a related structure called a do while loop.
What is a loop? A loop simply repeats some code again and again,
until a termination condition is encountered. A while loop is the simplest loop

*Each time the loop content is executed we call it an iteration.

The while condition (inside the parenthesis) is some JavaScript code, perhaps or maybe a variable. 
if the condition is evaluated to true then the code inside the braces will be executed.
When this code is finished, then it will come back up the top and it will check again,
is the condtition still true? If it is, the code will be executed again.
We have a so called loop pattern. Remember that exclamation mark,
it means the opposite, right? It's the Not operator.
