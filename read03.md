### Boxes

All HTML elements can be considered as boxes.The CSS box model is essentially a box that wraps around every HTML element. 
It consists of: margins, borders, padding, and the actual content.



*Block and inline boxes
In CSS we broadly have two types of boxes â€” block boxes and inline boxes. These characteristics refer to how the box behaves in terms of page flow, and in relation to other boxes on the page:

If a box is defined as a block, it will behave in the following ways:

The box will break onto a new line.
The box will extend in the inline direction to fill the space available in its container. In most cases this means that the box will become as wide as its container, filling up 100% of the space available.
The width and height properties are respected.
Padding, margin and border will cause other elements to be pushed away from the box
